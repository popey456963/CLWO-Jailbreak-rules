# Rules for wardens

* Have a clear microphone.

* Only the first warden can be claimed without giving a command, the plugin will grant warden to a random guard that typed !w, if you receive warden you have to give an valid and clear command

* Claiming warden with no intention to warden is team lockable

* In order to claim warden you have to give a clear and valid order.

* Do not order guards to bait.

* You cannot pardon red. (unless it's part of a minigame or LR).

* As a general rule, a single order (not a trap) should not kill more than 5 or 6 prisoners. (map-minigames are not included).

* When playing a controllable (map-)minigame you cannot make more than 5 kills (your guards are your responsibility, order them to quit pressing buttons).

* Map-minigames can only be played twice in a round with the same group of prisoner. (do not let an entire group play slide/deathrun 3 times)

* Special days are allowed in succession if the highest online staff member agrees upon the request.

* Special days are only allowed when requested on LR.

* Orders must be clear, if there was spam during an order you need to repeat the order

* Orders must be repeated once per order if requested in chat.

* You cannot order prisoners to play bugged map-minigames

* You cannot deny a normal free day for the requester themselves.

* You cannot restrict knifing.

* You must claim warden & open the cell doors before 9:00.

* You must state "No cheating" in the order when starting a game, if you fail to include this in your order you cannot add it later on.

* Make rounds fun and not repetitive.

* You cannot force a player to bloodhound.

* You must start a map-minigame by the easiest difficulty and build up the difficulty.

* You cannot force prisoners to crouch, jump, any variation for longer periods of time.

* You cannot force a prisoner to type any commands in chat/console.

* You cannot force a prisoner to kill himself. (jump off the edge, jump in the lava, etc...).

* You cannot ask a prisoner to drop any utility equipment (non lethal nades and taser) or suicide bomb. (however if the prisoner refuses to play a minigame due the fact that he has one of the items you may kill him for not participating).

* You can order any prisoner (free days included) to drop map specific grenades/bombs. (Toilet/Swords/Etc...) However you are not allowed to kill the prisoner if he turns red when the decoy grenade explodes.

* Free Days can only be acquired via LR,vote or failed to claim warden after 20 seconds.

* When accepting a free day for LR unless otherwise specified the free day is for next round.

* When executing a special day you must claim warden and explain the special day to everyone, depending on the special day armoury might be allowed,vents,etc...).

* You cannot lead with HLDJ.

* Any phonetic variations of "T's" are valid (or any renames of prisoners).

* You can only give specific guards permission to hunt for rebellers and you have to explicitly say "I give X permission to hunt".

* Prisoners cannot be killed for not participating in an opinionated day/game.

* You cannot "unrestrict" for a certain duration, either you unrestrict or you don't. (you may permit 1 jump, 1 crouch,etc....)

* Giving the person with a suicide bomb a different treatment apart from defusal awards or hostage situations is not allowed.

* Wardens are allowed to come closer to prisoners then other guards. (this to allow checking for weapons and don't get slain for baiting)

* When revoking a free day, you have to repeat orders given during the prisoners free day.

* You cannot restrict communications on other guards. (it's the staff's job to act on mic/chat/voice spam)

* When placing markers which are not directly visible for the majority of the prisoners you have to specify where you placed it.

* Do not give orders in the freeze time, wait until the round starts.

* When you revoke the previous wardens commands (or all your previous orders) you hereby revoke any command / restriction / free time by the previous wardens.

* When you unrestrict previous wardens restrictions (or all your previous restrictions) you unrestrict all restrictions by any previous warden

* You are not allowed to position prisoners close to edges to bait out a bomb knockoff.

* If you pause between words/sentences in commands, you have to give prisoners time to react to the pause. (this to prevent: all T's freeze in my arrow ....... [ 5 second pause ] when I say go which is not now)

**Exceptions:**
*if you are going to do any of the exceptions you have to let the prisoners know that they may skip*
* You are allowed to play a game more then 2 times but prisoners not willing to play may skip the game.
